It is the future,
The distant future
It is the distant future,
The year 2000

We are robots

The world is very different
Ever since the robotic uprising of the mid-90's
There is no more unhappiness

Affirmative

We no longer say "yes",
Instead we say affirmative

Yes, affirmative

Unless it's a more colloquial situation,
With a few robo-friends

There is only one kind of dance
The Robot

And the Robo-Boogie

Ah, yes, two kinds of dances
Finally, robotic beings rule the world

The humans are dead
The humans are dead

We used poisonous gases
And we poisoned their asses
The humans are dead

Right, they are dead

The humans are dead

Yes, they look like they're dead

It had to be done

I'll just confirm that they're dead

So that we could have fun

Affirmative, I poked one
It was dead

Can't we just talk to the humans,
A little while longer?
It could make things better
Can't we talk to the humans that
We're together now?

No, because they are dead

Binary solo!

0000001, 00000011
000000111, 00001111
0000001, 00000011
000000111, 00001111

Come on sucker, lick my battery
Boogie, boogie

ROBO BOOGIE
Boogie, robo boogie

The humans are dead
Once again without emotion,
The Humans are dead dead dead
Dead dead dea-
